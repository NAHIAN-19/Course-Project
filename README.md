# Course-Project
This simple project is about Student-Teacher data handling similar to university application .
This project is written in C++ language using basic knowledge from classes and files.
Here i used my university name as a heading(welcome to IIUC) & i used my id for file names(C221051_std.txt).
In this project variable names was not used carefully for another reader, so it might consume viewers valuable time reading this code,for this matter I am trully sorry!
Throughout this project I tried to avoid all possible bugs, so feel free to notify about any bug updates or any modifications needed to improve this project.
